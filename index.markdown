# Role of this site

The goal of this site is to propose a vendor-agnostic definition of graph data platform, as a dedicated category of applications.

Once established, it will be used to collect best-practices and design patterns to help software and hardware engineers, architects and business owners to make educated decisions.

# Connected and linked data
Ability to handle and manage connected and linked data at scale with high confidence is competitive advantage. 
If executed correctly on a massive scale, it can provide strategic advantage. 

# The platform

There are number of challenges in engineering, operating and business when it comes to operating with connected and linked data.

Incomplete list:
- data acquisition and curation
- entity discovery, linking and resolution
- traversal (both for transactional and analytical workloads)
- integrations with other systems
- data integrity and consistency
- traceability 

Furthermore, each and single project could add their own specific requirements.
This leads to an unavoidable tradeoffs, which needs to take place to provide optimal and balanced solution. 

Understanding these tradeoffs and the capabilities of existing libraries, frameworks, engines and applications is crucial for designing and delivering the graph platform to handle connected and linked data.
