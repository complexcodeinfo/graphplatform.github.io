# Graph Platform

The goal of this site to collect details and design decisions when it comes to implementing **graph data platform**. 

But what is it? What is the graph data platform?

# Connected and linked data

Graph is nothing but a model suche relationships and connections between various things.

As the number and complexity of such connections grows, it is getting harder to maintain it by a single person or a single device.

And as with many things as scale, the more complex sistem requires more people and solutions to get involved to make it all running as intented.

Therefore, the term "graph platform" naitevely comes to mind as a some kind of a system to  interract linked and connected data.

# The Platform 
So, there are already engines, libraries, applications, frameworks and patterns to work with graphs.

Can't we just use it? Why where is a need to have a platform?

Here, with the help of the graph community, there is a hope to answer this question with as much required depth as possible.
