# Graph Platform

It is the year 2022, and Wikipedia does not not have an article about Graph Data Platform. It would be good to learn the original of the term someday, but at this moment some graph database vendors are using this term to paint a bright future of when data is used for the better and faster way to manage highly connected data.

In some cases, certain software engineers are given a task to design and deliver such platform for their orgnanizations and customers.

But what is it? What is the graph data platform?

# Connected and linked data

The next dimension to compete is beyond the ability to calculate (general computing), store (big data), analyse (AI/ML) is to connect and piece together information from multiple sources. 

Hence, graph is nothing but a model suche relationships and connections between various things.

As the number and complexity of such connections grows, it is getting harder to maintain it by a single person or a single device.

And as with many things as scale, the more complex sistem requires more people and solutions to get involved to make it all running as intented.

Therefore, the term "graph platform" naitevely comes to mind as a some kind of a system to  interract linked and connected data.

# The Platform 
So, there are already engines, libraries, applications, frameworks and patterns to work with graphs.

Can't we just use it? Why where is a need to have a platform?

Here, with the help of the graph community, there is a hope to answer this question with as much required depth as possible.
